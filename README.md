# HWmonitor & DSPlink

This is Debug tool, for visualizing digital signals from DSP or Microcontroller on Oscilloscope screen. In adition contains USB<->Serial converter to allow debug 
communication with target device.

Heart of the device is fast SPI D/A converter AD5324ARMZ, transfering 4 channels into analog values, post processed by operational amplifiers. High voltage 8kVrms galvanic isolation is provided between all outputs, to ensure safe debug experience, especially with high voltage power converters. 

All design files, BOM, are included in this repository. Device does not require any FW for operation.
